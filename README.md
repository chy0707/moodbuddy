# MoodBuddy 🌱

**MoodBuddy** is a privacy-first mood tracking app designed to help people gently reflect, take small supportive actions, and understand emotional patterns over time — without pressure, judgment, or dark patterns.

> Not a productivity tool.  
> Not a diagnosis tool.  
> Just a calm space to check in with yourself.

## ✨ What MoodBuddy Does

MoodBuddy supports emotional awareness through three lightweight layers:

### 1. Daily Mood Check-in
- Simple mood selection (no long questionnaires)
- Optional notes and context
- Weather snapshot captured automatically

### 2. Gentle Actions
- 3–5 small, low-effort suggestions per day
- Suggestions adapt to the user’s mood
- Completion is optional, not mandatory

### 3. Reflection & Trends
- Calendar view of moods and actions
- Weekly / Monthly mood trends aligned to real calendar periods
- Simple summaries that highlight patterns, not scores

All data stays **local**. No account required.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

MoodBuddy is built around a few core principles:

- **Privacy-first**  
  No cloud sync, no accounts, no tracking. Everything is stored locally.

- **Low pressure**  
  No streak anxiety, no gamified punishment, no “you failed” states.

- **User agency**  
  Users choose how much they engage. Suggestions are supportive, never prescriptive.

- **Explainable insights**  
  Trends and summaries are transparent and easy to understand.

## 🎨 App Icon Design

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/icon/moodbuddy_icons.png" width="160" />
</p>

The MoodBuddy app icon is designed to represent **gentle presence rather than explicit emotion**.

Instead of expressive faces or emotionally charged symbols, the icon uses a soft, abstract combination of a **moon and sun**, symbolizing emotional cycles, balance, and continuity over time. The rounded square shape provides a sense of stability, while the minimal geometry keeps the visual experience calm and non-intrusive.

This design reflects MoodBuddy’s core philosophy:

- Emotions are **observed, not judged**
- Well-being is **cyclical, not linear**
- Support should feel **safe, calm, and optional**

MoodBuddy is not here to tell users how they should feel —  
it simply offers a quiet space where feelings are allowed to exist.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **UI**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Local component state + Context
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (MVP phase)
- **Charts**: Custom SVG (no heavy charting libraries)

The app is intentionally kept lightweight and dependency-minimal.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

Planned next iterations include:

- **Discover (Activities)**  
  A swipe-based discovery experience for nearby activities after check-in or action completion, with user-controlled preferences.

- **Insight Quality Upgrade**  
  More human-readable reflections combining mood, actions, and trends.

- **Optional Persistence Layer**  
  Migration path to a backend (e.g. Supabase) if needed — without compromising privacy defaults.

## 🧩 Why This Project Exists

MoodBuddy started as an exploration of a simple question:

> *What would a mental-wellbeing app look like if it respected users’ emotional energy as much as their data?*

Instead of maximizing engagement, MoodBuddy focuses on:
- clarity over quantity
- calm over stimulation
- reflection over optimization
