> This document reflects early-stage product design thinking for MoodBuddy.
> Details may evolve as the product iterates.

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** MoodBuddy

**One-line Description**  
MoodBuddy is a privacy-first mood tracking application that helps users gently reflect on their emotions, take small supportive actions, and understand emotional patterns over time — without pressure, judgment, or over-intervention.

MoodBuddy is not a therapy product.  
It is a calm, supportive space for everyday emotional awareness.

## 2. Background & Motivation

College students and young adults increasingly face emotional stress caused by academic pressure, social isolation, cultural transitions, and uncertainty about the future. While professional mental health services are essential, many users do not seek them due to cost, stigma, accessibility, or emotional readiness.

MoodBuddy is designed to fill the gap between clinical mental health services and everyday emotional needs. Instead of diagnosing or treating mental health conditions, MoodBuddy focuses on:

- helping users notice how they feel  
- encouraging small, manageable supportive actions  
- enabling long-term self-reflection through patterns, not scores  

All interactions are designed to feel optional, lightweight, and non-judgmental.

---

## 3. Target Users

MoodBuddy is designed for users who:

- want to build emotional awareness without committing to therapy  
- prefer private, low-pressure reflection  
- feel overwhelmed by highly gamified or productivity-driven wellness apps  
- value transparency and control over personal data  

The MVP primarily targets:
- college students  
- early-career young adults  
- users exploring self-reflection tools for the first time

## 5. Design Philosophy

MoodBuddy is built around the following principles:

- **Low pressure over engagement maximization**  
  No streak punishment, no missed-day warnings.

- **User agency over automation**  
  Suggestions support users; they do not instruct or evaluate them.

- **Clarity over gamification**  
  Visualizations explain patterns rather than rank performance.

- **Respect for emotional energy**  
  Every interaction is optional and reversible.

## 8. Why MoodBuddy

MoodBuddy explores a simple but often overlooked question:

> What would an emotional support app look like if it prioritized gentleness, autonomy, and clarity over engagement metrics?

By focusing on small actions and long-term reflection, MoodBuddy aims to help users build emotional awareness sustainably — one check-in at a time.
